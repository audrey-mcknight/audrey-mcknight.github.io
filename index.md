## Audrey McKnight

I am a 11th grade student attending Langley High School. My primary interests are in Computer Science and Language (Linguistics especially!). I like math too, and I am Vice President of the Langley Math Club. I also love Game Theory (the mathematical field, not the Youtube Channel), and Cryptology.
